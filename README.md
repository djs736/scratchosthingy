# scratchosthingy
:p


basically im developing a operation system in scratch with tons of extensions 
it will include its own "coding language" which in the moment is eternal pain where every word starts and ends with \ and end every line with | mostly to make it easier

UPD
changing code to json so easier but like extra annoying to code :/
note: might make an ide thing that turns list into json for easy use :P
